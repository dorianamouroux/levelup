# Level Up

iOS app to find programming exercises to level-up your skills! This project was made for a shool project. I had to either create an Android or iOS app. I chose iOS because I was very curious about Swift itself, I think it can make a great backend language and I hope it will take off.  

However I found the learning curve of iOS pretty steep, I rather go for React-Native if I had to do another iOS app. Anyway, you can see my code here, I'm using Firebase for authentication and database. I didn't bother protect my API keys, protect the database, etc. So please be nice ðŸ™‚ ðŸ™‚.
  
I'm no mobile developer and I don't want to.
  
That being said, if you want to install and test it, here's how.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/dorianamouroux/levelup.git
cd levelup
pod install
open levelup.xcworkspace
```

No unit testing, aint nobody got time for that
